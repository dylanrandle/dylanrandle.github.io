<img style="float: right; margin:10px" src="images/headshot.jpg">

I am a passionate **data scientist** with a particular interest in **deep learning**. I have worked on NLP and CV problems as well as more exotic applications like solving differential equations and differentiable neural architecture search. I love reading papers and staying up to date on the latest techniques. My focus is on solving challenging **applied research** problems.

In my spare time, I enjoy skiing (water and snow), hiking, camping, golfing, playing guitar, listening to music, and watching sports.
