## Summary

I am currently studying for my masters in **Data Science** at **Harvard University**.
Previously I was the first and head **Data Scientist** at **Hubdoc, Inc.** ([acquired](https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-scoops-up-hubdoc-in-70-million-acquisition/) by Xero Limited) where I developed a production
**deep NLP system** delivering massive cost and speed improvements. Before that, I
studied Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley, graduating
with High Honors.

## Research

- I am currently a member of the research group at the **Institute of Applied Computational Science** at Harvard University where
I am investigating ways to use deep learning methods to solve ordinary and partial differential equations. Repository: [here](https://github.com/dylanrandle/pde_nn), website: forthcoming

## Projects

- [Spark Tensorflow](https://github.com/dylanrandle/spark-tensorflow): training neural networks with Tensorflow
on a Spark/Hadoop-YARN cluster with AWS Elastic Map Reduce
- [Twitter Troll Detection](https://dylanrandle.github.io/troll_classification): project to identify Twitter
trolls from data collected in relation to a 2016 U.S. indictment of the Russian Internet Research Agency
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://github.com/dylanrandle/autograd): Python package that performs automatic
differentiation, supporting both forward and reverse modes
- [Bayesian Generative Adversarial Networks](https://dylanrandle.github.io/bayesgan.html): paper review and
demo of Bayesian GANs

## Personal

In my spare time I like to learn new things, spend time in the outdoors (hiking, skiing, canoeing), and work on interesting machine learning projects.
