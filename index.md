## Background

I grew up in [Toronto, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto), attending [Upper Canada College](https://www.ucc.on.ca/) for high school, and studying math, physics, and economics. For college, I moved across the continent to [Berkeley, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California) where I had the privilege of studying at [UC Berkeley's College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), and majored in [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) (a branch of applied mathematics focusing on business applications).

<!-- ### *Education* -->

Thereafter, I became the first data scientist at an exciting Toronto startup called [Hubdoc](https://www.hubdoc.com/), where I worked with bright and talented colleagues to design, develop and deploy a client-facing, production deep-learning system for information extraction from financial documents. This system was central to the company's value proposition and [later acquisition](https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-scoops-up-hubdoc-in-70-million-acquisition/).

<!-- ### *Work Experience* -->

Realizing that the future of data science and machine learning would be bright, I enrolled in [Harvard's data science program](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-data-science) to gain a deeper understanding of the field. At Harvard I have relished the chance to work and learn with incredible colleagues and mentors. Over the summer I interned with Amazon Robotics in Boston, MA, and greatly enjoyed the technical and engineering work being done there.
