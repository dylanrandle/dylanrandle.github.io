## Background

I grew up in Toronto, Canada where I attended [Upper Canada College](https://www.ucc.on.ca/) and enjoyed studying math, physics, and economics. For college, I moved to Berkeley, California where I had the privilege of studying at [UC Berkeley's College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), majoring in [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) (a branch of applied mathematics focusing on business applications).

Later I became the first data scientist at an exciting Toronto startup called [Hubdoc](https://www.hubdoc.com/), where I got to work with bright and talented colleagues to design, develop, and deploy a client-facing, production deep-learning system for information extraction from financial documents. This system was central to the company's value proposition and [later acquisition](https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-scoops-up-hubdoc-in-70-million-acquisition/).

Realizing that the future of data science and machine learning would be bright, I enrolled in [Harvard's data science program](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-data-science) to gain a deeper understanding of the field. At Harvard I have relished the chance to work and learn alongside incredible peers and professors. Recently, I interned with [Amazon Robotics](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/) where I greatly enjoyed taking part in the technical and engineering work being done there.
