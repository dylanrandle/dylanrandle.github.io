<!-- ## Background -->

<!-- I grew up in Toronto, Canada where I attended Upper Canada College for high school. I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma, taking higher-levels in math, physics, and economics. I was an active member of Model United Nations and traveled across North America to compete in debates.

For undergraduate, I enrolled in the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I studied Industrial Engineering & Operations Research and fell in love with mathematical optimization and statistics.

I worked for two years after undergrad at a startup (which was later acquired) as its first data scientist. I designed, developed, and deployed their first machine learning system (a text extraction service using LSTMs) and hired two great engineers to join my team.

Currently I'm studying Data Science at Harvard. -->
