## About

![headshot](pics/headshot.jpg)

My name is ***Dylan Labatt Randle*** and I am currently studying for my masters in **Data Science at Harvard University**.
Previously I worked as a **Data Scientist at Hubdoc** where I developed a production *deep NLP system* delivering massive cost
and speed improvements. Before that, I studied **Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley**, graduating
with High Honors and a 3.9/4.0 GPA.

## Research

- I am currently researching **physics-aware neural networks** for solving partial differential equations. The goal of this
this research is a) to invent new architectures that obey laws of physics, and b) to achieve generalizable higher-resolution
solutions to differential equations of important scientific and engineering interest (e.g. Navier-Stokes equations).

## Projects

- [Twitter Troll Detection](https://dylanrandle.github.io/troll_classification): project to identify Twitter
trolls from data collected in relation to a 2016 U.S. indictment of the Russian Internet Research Agency.

- [Automatic Differentiation](https://github.com/dylanrandle/autograd): Python package that performs automatic
differentiation, supporting both forward and reverse modes.

- [Bayesian Generative Adversarial Networks](https://dylanrandle.github.io/bayesgan.html): paper review and
demo of Bayesian GANs.

## Relevant Classes

- At **UC Berkeley** I focused significantly in the Operations Research field and took classes in *statistics,
probability, machine learning, stochastic processes and optimization*.

    - CS205: High Performance Parallel Systems
    - AC221: Critical Thinking in Data Science
    - AC299R: Supervised Research


## Personal

In my spare time, I like to waterski...
