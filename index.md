I am a passionate **data scientist** with a particular interest in **deep learning**. I have worked on NLP and CV problems as well as more exotic applications like solving differential equations and differentiable neural architecture search. I love reading papers and staying up to date on the latest techniques. My focus is on solving challenging **applied research** problems.

In my spare time, I enjoy skiing (both on water and snow), hiking, camping, golfing, playing the guitar, listening to music (country, folk, western, funk, hip-hop, electronic), and watching sports (hockey, football).
