Hello! Welcome to my personal website.

## About

![headshot](pics/headshot.jpg)

My name is Dylan Randle and I am currently studying for my masters in Data Science at Harvard University, in the School of
Engineering & Applied Sciences. This summer, I will be interning with Amazon Robotics, where I hope to learn about the use
of data science to analyze and predict performance in Amazon's robotics-driven fulfillment centers, at massive scale. I
am also conducting research in physics-aware machine learning methods with applications to turbulence modeling under the
supervision of Pavlos Protopapas and David Sondak.

## Personal

I am an avid guitar player and adventurous outdoorsman; in the future, I may post some interesting guitar and/or
outdoors-related content here! For now, enjoy this stunning sunset picture from one of my favorite places: Camp Ahmek
on Canoe Lake!
