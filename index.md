# Research

- [Deep Learning in Physics](https://dylanrandle.github.io/ac299_website/): I am currently a member of the research group at the Institute of Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard University where I am investigating ways to use deep learning methods to solve ordinary and partial differential equations. Code is currently private but will be forthcoming
  1. [Neural Networks in Turbulence](https://dylanrandle.github.io/ac299_website/Channel_Flow.html)
  2. [GANs for Differential Equations](https://dylanrandle.github.io/ac299_website/GAN.html#baby-equation)

# Projects

- [Twitter Troll Detection](https://dylanrandle.github.io/troll_classification): Project achieving 96% accuracy classifying Twitter trolls using tweets scraped from accounts indicted for meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://github.com/dylanrandle/autograd): Python package implementing automatic differentiation, supporting both forward and reverse modes; stochastic gradient descent and Adam optimizers implemented as example use-case
- [Bayesian GANs](https://dylanrandle.github.io/bayesgan.html): Paper review, implementation, and demo of Bayesian generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- [Tensorflow on Spark](https://github.com/dylanrandle/spark-tensorflow): Training neural networks on a 1.5 TB dataset with Tensorflow on a Spark/Hadoop cluster with AWS Elastic Map Reduce


# Personal

In my spare time I love to learn new things, read books, spend time outside, and work on interesting machine learning projects.
