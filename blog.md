## My 10,000 Hours

Last night, I started reading Malcolm Gladwell's book, *Outliers*, and today I would like to write down my thoughts about it. In *Outliers*, Gladwell seeks to uncover the hidden alchemy of success and dispel the widespread myths surrounding it. He asserts that our common notion that success is achieved through some kind of utopian meritocratic process is patently false. In hockey, he explains, the vast majority of successful players share a single characteristic: their birthdate's proximity to January 1. Why is this? It's simple: hockey's age cutoff begins on January 1, and so players born closest to the cutoff will be the most mature in their cohort.

One would not, at first, imagine this to be a huge difference-maker. However, Gladwell is quick to point out that it serves to reinforce a self-fulfilling prophecy inherent in hockey's development model. When players are young, say below the age of eight, hockey players all play together. But at this young age, a few months of maturity can make a big difference, and so those players born close to January 1 tend to excel. This leads them to be selected for advanced training, the effect of which becomes compounded over many years, and voila: our best hockey players are overwhelmingly born from January-March.

So, Gladwell muses, perhaps success is not purely based on talent. Indeed, maybe our environment and the circumstances in which we grow up is a better predictor of how high up the ladder we will climb. Investigating this notion further, Gladwell turns to world-class musicians. Here he finds that the secret to utter mastery of an instrument lies in a seemingly arbitrary yet highly recurrent number: **10,000 hours** (of practice). It is this number that he finds cropping up everywhere he looks. Whether it be back with the hockey players or in his interviews with high performers across fields as diverse as music, software engineering, and management. Gladwell even posits that Mozart may have only produced his best works--works which truly deserve the "masterpiece" designation--after he had reached the 10,000 hour mark in his twenties.

This led me to think: "what are my 10,000 hours?" and what would I like to do with them? Throughout my childhood I focused on various pastimes. Early on, I played hockey and competed in alpine skiing races; in my teens I focused on academics and became interested in mathematics, physics, and economics; in my spare time I developed an enthusiasm for Rubik's cubes: either solving big ones (like the 7x7x7 or the 12-sided Megaminx), or solving them quickly (speedcubing, as it is known, e.g. solving a 3x3x3 in under 20 seconds); I even regularly played, and still play, the guitar. But upon reflection, I must conclude that it is mathematics, without a doubt, wherein lies my potential to reach the all-important 10,000 hour mark.

In high school I was in the advanced math class, a member of the math society, and wrote my high school thesis on a subject in mathematics; I had a tutor who would take me through advanced topics every week, and my innate passion for the subject has led me to pursue a master's in data science and to work on math-related subjects in my professional life. If we group together the disparate fields in which I have worked (mathematics, physics, operations research, data science), and place them all under the banner of mathematics, my rough accounting estimates I have spent between 8,000 and 10,000 hours in the practice of mathematics. I hope I am soon be due for my masterpiece! *-Dylan Randle (July 4, 2019)*

## The "AI-Revolution"

I recently re-read an [article](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wot7mkc1) which I have become very fond of: "Artificial Intelligence: The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" by one of the most respected researchers in the world of computer science and statistics, Michael I. Jordan. The article is his take on the AI hype, and serves as an important framing of the new field of "data science" for all the researchers in the field.

The essence of Jordan's message is this: the current round of AI innovations are not intelligent. This is backed up by others who have claimed deep learning is merely "curve-fitting", albeit in high dimensional space. And it is true, our deep learning systems come nowhere close to having common-sense and higher-level reasoning capabilities akin to humans. These deep learning achievements (and they certainly are incredible achievements) amaze us with their shows of raw sensorimotor skills, yet they continue to lack true intelligence.

All the while, our world is swimming in data and is unable to leverage it to its full potential. The status quo is one in which patients are routinely misdiagnosed simply due to the improper application of rudimentary statistical analyses (Jordan gives the example of his child whose life would have been put at undue risk due to the application of a miscalibrated statistical test).

The point is this: don't become enthralled by the "AI" achievements we are seeing and place all our faith in them for solving our problems (did chemical engineers believe an AI god would design their chemical plants?). We need a principled approach to solving our problems, not some fantastical fiction about an omnipresent AI who will do our bidding.

We lack an ability to bring together disparate data across time and space and to make appropriate conclusions from it. We are behind in the pursuit of augmented intelligence, whereby data can assist humans in decision-making by strengthening our quantitative abilities (which turns out to be the place in which computers have us beat, for now). We should remain inspired and continue to drive the field of AI forward, but it is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture and, in doing so, forget there are many tangible issues *right now* (not just AI!) that require distributed systems, statistics, privacy, and machine learning solutions. *-Dylan Randle (July 4, 2019)*
