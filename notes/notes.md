Acknowledgements: This material is largely guided by the book [*All of Statistics* (Larry Wasserman, 2004)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/index.html), certainly one my favorite books on statistics. I have also drawn inspiration from [*Computer Age Statistical Inference* (Efron, Hastie, 2016)](https://hastie.su.domains/CASI/index.html).
